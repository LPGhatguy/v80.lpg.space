Hello, I'm Lucien!

I write software, play Magic: the Gathering, and enjoy the great outdoors. I am a strong believer in accessible software, welcoming communities, and free educational resources.

I have worked as a software engineer at a handful of companies:

* **DreamCraft** (2020—) on the hit game [Adopt Me!](https://playadopt.me)
* [**Roblox**](https://www.roblox.com) (2017—2020) where I created projects like [Roact](https://github.com/Roblox/roact)
* [**Gecko Designs**](https://www.geckodesigns.com) (2015—2017) on websites for large brands like Gillette and Febreze
* [**Univision Computers**](https://univisioncomputers.com) (2011—2014) where I got my start!

I'm the creator and maintainer of [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo), an important tool in the top Roblox developer community. It enables Roblox developers to leverage the large body of traditional software development tools. It has a few related projects like [rbx-dom](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rbx-dom) and [Remodel](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/remodel).

In my recent free time, I've been working in the Rust game development ecosystem. I maintain a couple simple libraries in that space: [Thunderdome](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/thunderdome) and [Crevice](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/crevice).
