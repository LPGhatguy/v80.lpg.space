I got my start with <a class="_a_007f8" href="https://www.roblox.com/create">Roblox Studio</a>, which was a very different piece of software back then. It includes a single-purpose text editor for editing Lua.</p><p class="_p_007f8">When it came time to start writing software outside of Roblox, probably beginning in early 2009, I cycled through a bunch of text editors. Notepad++, Scintilla, and Visual Studio 2008 are the big ones I remember. Eventually, I found Sublime Text 2. To this day, it's one of the only pieces of software I've paid for more than once.</p><p class="_p_007f8">My Sublime Text setup varied only a little bit over the years. I built a custom theme or two but eventually reverted to stock. I adopted Vim emulation using Vintage after meeting a curious fellow in my hometown. Later on, that became Vintageous and finally NeoVintageous.</p><p class="_p_007f8">Notably, I never really wrote any of my own extensions. My editor customization was only skin deep, and I thought that was fine.</p></div><div></div></article></div></div><footer class="_Footer_c92f1"><div class="_FooterInner_c92f1"><span class="_Item_c92f1"><img class="_Icon_c92f1" src="/iconmonstr-twitter-1.4b3cbcb7.svg"><a title="My Twitter profile" href="https://twitter.com/LPGhatguy">LPGhatguy</a></span><span class="_Item_c92f1"><img class="_Icon_c92f1" src="/iconmonstr-github-1.54a762db.svg"><a title="My GitHub profile" href="https://github.com/LPGhatguy">LPGhatguy</a></span><span class="_Item_c92f1"><img class="_Icon_c92f1" src="/iconmonstr-linkedin-3.a124480b.svg"><a title="My LinkedIn profile" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucien-greathouse-539bb73b">LinkedIn</a></span></div></footer></div> <script src="/src.618365c5.js"></script> </body></html>
